The Indian Premier League (IPL) (currently known as the Pepsi Indian Premier League for sponsorship reasons[1]) is an annual Twenty20 cricket tournament, founded in 2008 by the BCCI. It consists of a number of teams (currently 8) which are named after Indian cities and owned by franchises, and is held in India between April and June.[N 1]

The IPL is the most-watched Twenty20 league in the world and is also known for its commercial success. In 2010, the IPL became the first sporting event to be broadcast live on YouTube. The brand value of the 2014 Indian Premier League was estimated to be around US$3.2 billion.[3]

The IPL is currently supervised by BCCI Vice-President Ranjib Biswal, who serves as the League's chairman and Commissioner.[4] Sundar Raman has been the IPL chief operating officer (COO) since its first season, after he was appointed by the former IPL Commissioner Lalit Modi in 2008.[5]

Of the 11 teams to have competed since its inception, five have won the title: Kolkata Knight Riders (2), Chennai Super Kings (2), Rajasthan Royals (1), Deccan Chargers (1), and Mumbai Indians (1).Chennai Super Kings being the most successful team so far having won the title twice and a semi final berth in all the seasons. The current champions are the Kolkata Knight Riders, who won the 2014 season by beating the Kings XI Punjab by 3 wickets.

The winning bidders for the eight franchises (or clubs) were announced on 24 January 2008.[21] While the total base price for auction was US$400 million, the auction fetched US$723.59 million.[22] Chennai Super Kings, Delhi Daredevils, Kings XI Punjab, Kolkata Knight Riders, Mumbai Indians, Rajasthan Royals, Royal Challengers Bangalore and Deccan Chargers were the founding clubs of the new professional league.

On 21 March 2010, teams from Pune (Pune Warriors India) and Kochi (Kochi Tuskers Kerala) were unveiled as the two new clubs for the fourth edition of the Indian Premier League. The base price was $225 million. While Pune was bought by Sahara Adventure Sports Group for $370 million, the Kochi franchise was bought by Rendezvous Sports World Limited for $333.3 million.[23] The second franchise auction fetched total $703 million.

The rights to the new Hyderabad franchise were awarded to the Sun TV Network in October 2012.[24]

There are five ways that a franchise can acquire a player: In the annual auction, signing domestic players, signing uncapped players, through trading, and signing replacements.[25][26] In the trading window, the player can only be traded with his consent. The franchise will have to pay the difference between the old contract price and the new contract price. If the new contract is worth more than the older one, then the difference will be shared between the player and the franchise selling the player.[27][28]

Some of the team composition rules are:

A minimum squad strength of 16 players plus one physiotherapist and a coach.
No more than 11 foreign players in the squad and a maximum of four foreign players should be in the playing eleven.
A minimum of 14 Indian players must be included in each squad.
A minimum of six players from the BCCI under-22 pool must be included in each squad.
IPL games utilise television timeouts, hence there is no time limit for teams to complete their innings. However, there may be a penalty if the umpires find teams misusing this privilege at their own choice. Additionally, each team is given a two-and-a-half-minute "strategic timeout" during each innings; one must be taken by the bowling team between the 6th to 10th overs, and the batting team between the 11th to 16th overs.[29]

The total spending cap for a franchise in the first player auction was US$5 million. Under-22 players are to be remunerated with a minimum annual salary of US$20,000 while for others it is US$50,000.

India's biggest property developer DLF Group paid ₹2.50 billion (around US$50 million) to be the title sponsor of the tournament for 5 years from 2008 to 2012.[33] From 2013 season, the American food and beverage company PepsiCo took over title sponsorship for five years valued at ₹3968 million, and also exclusive beverage supplier for the IPL teams in the 2013 season.[34][35]

The IPL is expected to bring the BCCI an income of approximately US$1.6 billion, over a period of five to ten years. All of these revenues are directed to a central pool, 40% of which will go to IPL itself, 54% to franchises and 6% as prize money. The money will be distributed in these proportions until 2017, after which the share of IPL will be 50%, franchises 45% and prize money 5%. The IPL signed up Kingfisher Airlines as the official umpire partner for the series in a INR1.06 billion (US$17 million) (approximately £15 million) deal. This deal sees the McDowells No.1 brand on all umpires' uniforms and also on the giant screens during third umpire decisions.[36]

Other sponsorships include, a deal with Hero Honda worth $22.5 million, with PepsiCo worth $12.5 million, and a deal with Kingfisher at $26.5 million.[37]

Television rights[edit]
On 17 January 2008 it was announced that a consortium consisting of India's Sony Entertainment Television(Set Max) network and Singapore-based World Sport Group secured the global broadcasting rights of the Indian Premier League.[38] The record deal has a duration of ten years at a cost of US$1.026 billion. As part of the deal, the consortium will pay the BCCI US$918 million for the television broadcast rights and US$108 million for the promotion of the tournament.[39] The initial plan was for 20% of these proceeds would go to IPL, 8% as prize money and 72% would be distributed to the franchisees from 2008 until 2012, after which the IPL would go public and list its shares.[40] However, in March 2010, IPL decided not to go public and list its shares. Sony-WSG then re-sold parts of the broadcasting rights geographically to other companies.
