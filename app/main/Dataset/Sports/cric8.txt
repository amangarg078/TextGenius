With actors Hrithik Roshan and Shahid Kapoor set to perform, the IPL opening ceremony on April 7 in Kolkata promises to be a glitzy and glamorous affair.

“Entertainers will descend on one stage, with the evening’s proceedings being hosted by Saif Ali Khan,” BCCI secretary Anurag Thakur said in a statement.

A dazzling line-up, including Farhan Akhtar, music director Pritam and Anushka Sharma will set the ball rolling.

Gautam Gambhir, captain of Kolkata Knight Riders, will put the trophy back in play, signalling the start of the season.

“The two-hour long show will start at 7.30 p.m. and the gates of the venue will open at 5 p.m. Tickets for the Opening Nite (prices starting at Rs 200) may be purchased at iplt20.com.”
