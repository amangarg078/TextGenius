    The regular expression matches all sentence ending punctuation and splits the string at those points.

    are separated from the actual text. The first s_iter line turns each group of two items in the list into a tuple,
    excluding the last item in the list (the last item in the list does not need to have this performed on it). Then,
    the second s_iter line combines each tuple in the list into a single item and removes any whitespace at the beginning
    of the line. Now, the s_iter list is formatted correctly but it is missing the last item of the sentences list. The
    second to last line adds this item to the s_iter list and the last line returns the full list.
