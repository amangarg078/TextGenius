In all the understandable attention paid to the Supreme Court's judgement on Section 66A, the media and the commentariat have overlooked another Supreme Court decision at roughly the same time which is potentially even more far-reaching and significant for our democracy.

In a 64-page judgment, a Bench of Justices Ranjan Gogoi and Rohinton Nariman (who also wrote the 66A judgement, though this one is mainly Justice Gogoi's work) struck down the UPA Government's notification including Jats in the Central list of OBCs. Equally significant was the rationale the Justices provided: they observed that the State should not go by the "perception of the self-proclaimed socially backward class or advanced classes" on whether they deserved to be categorised among the "less fortunates." New formulae, the Court averred, have to be found to determine backwardness.

Most significantly, the Supreme Court held that caste, while acknowledged to be a prominent cause of injustice in the country historically, could not be the sole determinant of the backwardness of a class. "Owing to historical conditions, particularly in Hindu society, recognition of backwardness has been associated with caste. Social groups who would be most deserving must necessarily be a matter of continuous evolution. New practices, methods and yardsticks have to be continuously evolved moving away from caste-centric definition of backwardness," the Court argued in its judgment.

The Court ruled that the State should maintain a high level of vigilance to uncover emerging forms of backwardness in a continually evolving society. "The gates would be opened only to permit entry of the most distressed. Any other inclusions would be a serious abdication of the constitutional duty of the State," the court warned.
