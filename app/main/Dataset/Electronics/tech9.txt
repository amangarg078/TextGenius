NEW DELHI: Twitter, Facebook, Whatsapp and other social media platforms have been misused on several occasions to spread hate campaign in the country, government said.

"Instances of misuse of Twitter, Facebook, email, blogs and Whatsapp to spread hate campaign in the country have come to the notice of the government from time to time," minister of state for home Haribhai Parthibhai Chaudhary said in reply to a written question.
