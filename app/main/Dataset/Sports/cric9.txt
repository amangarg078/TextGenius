Star India cricketer Suresh Raina has tied the nuptial knot with fiancée Priyanka in a private ceremony attended only by family members and close friends, including his national and IPL team-mates, at a posh hotel here.

The couple tied the knot late on Friday night in a ceremony attended by among others, ICC Chairperson N Srinivasan and India and Chennai Super Kings captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni.

The 28-year-old Raina and Priyanka, who is presently working in The Netherlands, have been friends since their childhood. Their family also has close association for a long time. In fact, Priyanka’s father was reportedly Raina’s sports teacher in Ghaziabad.

Big wigs from politics and entertainment world, besides fellow cricketers including Dwayne Bravo, Michael Hussey and Stephen Fleming, attended the ceremony.

Test captain Virat Kohli and his girl friend Anushka Sharma had attended the couple’s engagement ceremony on Wednesday.

Middle-order batsman Raina returned to the country with his India teammates after the semifinal loss to Australia in the World Cup last week.
Raina is contracted with the Chennai Super Kings, who are scheduled to kickstart their campaign in the eighth edition of the Indian Premier League on April 9, barely six days after his wedding.
