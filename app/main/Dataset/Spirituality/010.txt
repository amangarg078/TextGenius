You are an achievement. You may not fully know why just yet. But you have probably felt, in some quiet way, the fact that you belong to something significant that has come before you in history. You might not always know how to express that feeling, but you know that it inspires you, and elevates you.
 
You belong to the one civilisation that still stands much as it once did even after all these thousands of years of human history; thousands of years of wars, conquest, pillage, subjugation, desecration and devastation, thousands of years of supposed progress that have given us a world today that runs on brutal violence against nature, life and the planet itself.
 
You belong to a civilisation that is still standing, but surrounded as it were, by a mess, in India and across the whole world, of environmental devastation, cultural confusion, ethical indifference, and economic insecurity.
 
But still, it stands. Still, there is hope. For a civilisation is not just buildings and machines, but its people, their thoughts and their culture. It is a way of knowing the world, a way of giving meaning and value to the contents of life.
 
It is a resource, most of all, for living intelligently. It is a form of culture, an expression of sensibility, a way of harmonising science, philosophy, and ethics in a people’s every thought, word and deed. You can call it a religion, a way of life, or a civilisation; you can call it what you will, but no word will suffice.
 
A billion people on this earth still call God by the same names that people did thousands of years ago. What exists on this earth unchanged for so long? What religion exists on this earth for that long, when so many people have distorted religion and dragged it down from being about love and freedom to being about hatred, coercion and war?
 
Hinduism could have been wiped out a long time ago. But it wasn’t. You are here. You still adore and worship your Ganesha, your Hanuman, your Shiva, Vishnu, Lakshmi and Parvati, and Rama and Krishna and Subramanya. You still have your name as did your forefathers. And you are able to deal as a friend and equal today with people of many faiths and races. It is an accomplishment unlike any other. It is not a boast but a fact. Your culture’s existence is a triumph of survival. Your existence is a triumph of survival.
 
What does it really mean to be Hindu today? In you, in your life, is something that should be studied, preserved, and revered like a work of art in a museum. It may be all messy and mixed up, with good and not so good sensibilities, like how you can see Krishna in an exquisite ancient sculpture and also in a crude animation form. Hindu civilisation is like that, all mixed up. But still, its greatest and most sublime elements are still here, and they are in you. These must not be worn lightly.
 
You must remember. We came from a world of wisdom we can barely fathom in today’s terms. And we are here, still.
 
We belong to a moment in history when Hinduism is beginning to wake up. If not from a long slumber, then at least a long silence. We did not speak to the world and to ourselves, as Hindus, in a very long time....We did not ask, until the present generation came of age really, that provocative question: what does it really mean to be Hindu today?
