hey called it “the Chelsea effect”. Senior advisers to Barack Obama coined the phrase during his 2008 campaign for president, after they noticed a surprising trend in the long and bitter battle for the nomination between the then-senator from Illinois and Hillary Clinton.

Wherever Clinton’s daughter, Chelsea, campaigned heavily in a state, the Obama people were alarmed to see polls tighten between the two rival candidates among a crucial demographic: young voters. In states such as Arkansas, California and Massachusetts, the 27-year-old Chelsea even helped neutralize Obama’s advantage with under-30s altogether.

Now, as her mother prepares to announce a second run for the White House, Chelsea Clinton is about to be unleashed as Hillary’s not-so-secret weapon.

Having spent much of her life trying to avoid her parents’ career path – in 2008 she was still working on Wall Street – Chelsea has finally, openly embraced her inheritance as part of one of America’s most powerful political dynasties. Clinton-watchers and family friends say she is certain to be a visible part of her mother’s bid, especially to women, for the highest political office in the world – though not without the invisible dangers on the way to becoming America’s first daughter once more.

“Those around the Clintons believe she’ll be a very senior adviser to her mom,” said Amie Parnes, co-author of the bestselling HRC: State Secrets and the Rebirth of Hillary Clinton. “Chelsea will be used in a big way this time around.”
