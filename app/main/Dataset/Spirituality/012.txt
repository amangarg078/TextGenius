As it evolved, Buddhism brings in bhakti as a valid source of knowledge and, therefore, moksha, but, surprisingly, does not advocate aesthetic experience despite the fact that Buddhists were the most prolific image makers and mural painters. On the other hand, in Hinduism, the Vedas recognise the kavi as prajapati.
 
 
However, it was Bharata’s Natyashastra, moving on to Anandavarsha’s Dhyanyaloka and then to Abhinavagupta’s Abhinavabharati and ending with Pandit Jagannatha’s concept of ramaniyata, that the rasa doctrine becomes the flagbearer of Hindu aesthetics.
 
 
The central plank of rasa is that the refined aesthetic experience that arises from embracing the rasa of art objects, be they sahitya, kavya, shilpa, natya or chitra, is akin to brahamananda, the bliss of Brahmn.
 
 
The only concession Hindu aesthetics makes is that the rasananda is brahmananda sahadora, the twin brother of Brahmn, and this makes the rasa experience one step removed from the experience of Brahmn. Hindu art in its manifold aspects remains life-affirming, sensually beautiful, but always pointing to serene spirituality, bridging the gap between the sacred and the spiritual.
 
 
The adept and committed rasika is able to move the beautiful art object to the serenely spiritual art experience, ensuring that the pursuit of the beautiful is a purushartha, a noble aim of life. The rasika in the Hindu tradition can take his place with pride alongside the jnani, bhakta and yogi, and the aesthetic experience is a valid one, capable of leading to knowledge and ending in the bliss of Brahmn itself.
